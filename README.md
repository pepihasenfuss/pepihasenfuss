Ungravel GroupWallet


Ungravel helps loose individuals to become a self-governed group, potentially attracting investor funding.

Ungravel is a distributed application for a bunch of people. It does not make sense to use it alone.

Ungravel is not a platform and it does not belong to a company. It is entirely based on blockchain. 

Ungravel groups may found a start-up or any other initiative together. Ungravel saves each members' belongings and share. 
It creates a fair and safe space for informal team building.

Ungravel morphs a wild bunch of people into a self-funded, self-governed disciplined group of co-workers.
