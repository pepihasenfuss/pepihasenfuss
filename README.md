Ungravel


Ungravel helps individuals to build a self-governed group, potentially attracting funding.

Ungravel groups may found a start-up or any other initiative together.
Ungravel saves each members' belongings and share. 

It creates a fair and safe space for informal team building, entirely based on Ethereum Naming Service, ENS, and the ENS Manager.

Ungravel on mainnet chains:

http://ethereum.ungravel.org ethereum mainnet          ( super-fast thanks to Infura, integrating ENS-Manager V3, but too expensive )

http://arbitrum.ungravel.org arbitrum                  ( super fast and really good user experience, thanks to BlockPi! )

http://base.ungravel.org base                          (new in fall 2024, pretty fast! Promising. Cheap transactions.)

http://blast.ungravel.org blast                        ( live on mainnet, quite cheap, fast )

http://polygon.ungravel.org polygon                    ( live on mainnet, fast, although a bit spooky )

http://optimism.ungravel.org optimism                  ( I cannot get enough test ether! Otherwise fast, therefore deprecating 2024 )

http://bscmain.ungravel.org binance                    ( live on mainnet, probably discontinued, but fast, not quite cheap )
