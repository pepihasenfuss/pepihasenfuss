Ungravel


Ungravel helps individuals to build a self-governed group, potentially attracting funding.

Ungravel groups may found a start-up or any other initiative together.
Ungravel saves each members' belongings and share. 

It creates a fair and safe space for informal team building, entirely based on Ethereum Naming Service, ENS, and the ENS Manager on Ethereum mainnet.
