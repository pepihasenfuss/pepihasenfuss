ungravel


ungravel helps loose individuals to become a self-governed group, potentially attracting investor funding.

ungravel groups may found a start-up or any other initiative  or informal group together.
ungravel saves each members' belongings and share. 

It creates a fair and safe space for informal team building, entirely based on Ethereum Naming Service, ENS, and the ENS Manager on Ethereum mainnet.

ungravel morphs a wild bunch of people into a self-funded, self-governed disciplined group of co-workers, represented as ENS-Groups on mainnet.

Sample ENS-Group:  https://app.ens.domains/ungravels.eth
